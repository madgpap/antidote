[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), also known as 'Linux for human beings' is a Debian-based Linux distribution, aligned with the principles of open source software development. Because of its user-friendliness, Ubuntu is one of the most popular operating systems for desktops, laptops and mobile phones. Ubuntu is also widely supported by cloud platforms, such as Amazon EC2, OpenStack and DigitalOcean.

Ubuntu will be the default operating system for Antidote.
